            The series was mainly produced by David Heyman and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as the three leading characters: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Four directors worked on the series: Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuarón, Mike Newell, and David Yates.[4] All eight movies had their screenplays written by Steve Kloves, with the exception of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), written by Michael Goldenberg. Production took over ten years to complete, with the main story arc following Harry Potter's quest to overcome his arch-enemy Lord Voldemort.
